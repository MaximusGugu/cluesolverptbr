When we decided to implement this change, we set out with a goal of maintaining the value of Rare Item Tokens vs the cost of Rare Items in order for there to be as little impact to you as possible.\n\nWhile that ratio holds true, it's clear from your feedback that we didn't meet expectations. Frankly, we misjudged the value Rare Item Tokens held by not fully considering the opportunity cost to acquire them and we're sorry for getting this wrong.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation since Monday, we have unfortunately confirmed that this is something we’re unable to resolve or change without entire server rollbacks – which would have even farther-reaching ramifications.\n\nAs an apology for this misstep, we’ll be gifting all players 15,000 extra Oddments to spend within the Oddments store. We'll also be awarding all players 15 Treasure Hunter keys to use too. These will roll out with next Monday's Game Update and be available for players who login within 3 months of the update. (Note: Accounts created on or after January 26th 2021 will not be eligible).\n\nAlso in next Monday's update, based on your feedback, we will also be bringing the Limited and Current Rare Items into the Oddments Store to ensure you can still pick up the items you want.\n\nToday’s change was just one part of a long term plan to consolidate our currencies for a better user experience. We do believe this change adds very beneficial improvements for all players moving forward, but yesterday it under-delivered on converting the value you already had.\n\nIn the future, we'll provide ample notice of any currency change before it happens and spend particular care on any currency conversion rates based on opportunity.\n\nThank you again for your feedback and patience.\n\n(We're also adding this to RuneScape.com in This Week In RuneScape shortly)\n","author":"JagexHooli","curator":"Nex Undique","source":null,"image":null,"icon":null,"expiryDate":null,"datePublished":"2021-01-26T16:53:54.000Z","dateAdded":"2021-01-26T17:20:43.000Z"},{"id":510,"url":"https://twitter.com/JagexRamen/status/1354091509843456001","title":"JagexRamen on Twitter","excerpt":"Support capes sometimes show the options for skillcapes other than those have been added to them.

The achievement interface displays nearly 3,000 achievements and some of their conditions are very programmatically complex, as RuneScape is a strange beast.\n\nWe'd basically reached the point where the volume of complex achievement data the achievement system needed to process was hitting the limits of our scripting language, so we needed to recreate all that data in a format the game engine interprets, to be able to continue adding achievements.\n\nOver time we intend to gradually phase out dependencies on the old achievement system, so we can retire it. And consequently be able to improve its interface.\n\nThe old achievement system is quite foundational, though, and still interfaces with a lot of game systems.\n\n​\n\nThe next step is to remove dependencies on the old achievement system from the quest system, so that quest developers only have to create quest achievements in the new achievement system instead of both. That's what should release in February.\n\nWe already created the new quest achievements and adapted the quest complete screen to display them in 2020's achievement release, so this won't affect your current quest data. This just entailed rewiring all the references to the old achievement system in the quest system to plug into the new achievement system, and removing redundancies wherever possible.\n\nAlthough a lot has changed under the hood (because the quest system also plugs into lots of sub-systems), there shouldn't be any player-facing difference, other than two key impacts:\n\n​\n\n1) Removal of quest achievements in achievement paths\n\nI've now migrated the quest system to fully interconnect with the new achievement system. However, the path system is entirely a feature of the old achievement system. The path system needs a complete rewrite to use the new achievement data format, which is a whole other project in itself.\n\n(A project I started last year, but had to put on hold to help Mod Asherz finish the achievement conversion project, which was a ginormous undertaking.)\n\nSo in order to release this quest increment ASAP (and therefore not further impact the quests and miniquests developed this year), I've had to remove all quest achievements from paths, and paths that are composed entirely of quests, such as the quest series paths, because quest achievements in the old format won't exist any more.\n\nie I've had to remove all the quest series paths listed here: https&#x3A;//runescape.wiki/w/Achievement_Paths#Paths\n\nThe quests themselves aren't gone! Just the achievement paths that list quests. So with all the paths with quests removed, the default path book looks like this:\n\nNovice Explorer\n\nArchaeology\n\nDungeoneering\n\nConstruction\n\nBossing\n\nI'm hoping those quest series paths aren't actually used very much. I implemented them before I implemented the Quest Series sort in the quest list, and I hope that largely makes them redundant. You can find out the full requirements for The World Wakes from the suggested quests in The World Wakes overview screen, for example, or get Ancient Curses by viewing the requirements for Temple at Senntisten.\n\nIt should be minimal work to recreate the quest paths if they're still desired, after rewriting the path system to use the new quest achievements. But mobile is the Core Experience team's #1 priority until its release, so I don't anticipate I'll be allowed to do any more work in the achievement space until mobile ships.\n\n​\n\n2) Quests and removed paths will be cleared from your activity tracker on login\n\nThe activity tracker was tracking quests using the old achievement system's IDs. As those have been removed, invalid IDs will be cleared when you log in. If you were tracking a quest and want to keep tracking it, you'll just need to set the quest as active in your quest interface.\n\nIf you were tracking one of the paths that've been removed, that path will also be cleared from your activity tracker, so that you don't have blank tracker slots.\n\n​\n\nI hope that provides some clarity, as this was quite an under-the-hood feature that's mostly invisible to players. (And largely mystifying to producers.) There should hopefully also be some patch notes on release that summarise the player-facing impact.\n\nOne other thing to expect on the achievement side, is an engine change to ignore skill requirements on achievements, so that they can be boosted. If all goes well that should release in the next full stack engine release in early February.\n","author":"Jagex_Stu","curator":"ImRubic","source":null,"image":null,"icon":null,"expiryDate":null,"datePublished":"2021-01-26T14:12:10.000Z","dateAdded":"2021-01-26T15:00:03.000Z"},{"id":508,"url":"https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/this-week-in-runescape---celebration-of-skilling","title":"This Week In RuneScape - Celebration of Skilling  - News - RuneScape","excerpt":"This Week In RuneScape we're celebrating Skilling!
